# earthquake-predict-svm
The LANL Earthquake Prediction project aims to predict the time until a 
lab-induced earthquake occurs using seismic signal data, employing 
advanced machine learning techniques like Support Vector Regression (SVR). 
Through innovative feature engineering and data synthesis, the team achieved 
a significant reduction in RMSE, showcasing the potential for real-world 
applications.

This was a project done for Colorado School of Mines CSCI470: Machine Learning, 
as a group project with members:
Cristian Madrazo
Linzhi Leiker
Ryan Sundberg
Elcin Eroglu
